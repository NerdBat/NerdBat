## Before Coding

I Started coding with java at age 11 ( big fan og minecraft ), then because of my lack of knowledge I stop after 3 month.
Then a few years after, we started learning python in math class. I was terrible at math but the best of all the student in python.
I got the best grade and i knew that i wanted to work as progrommaer. At the end of the year i changed of school to take my last 2 yers of high school in STI2D. I learn a lot of things and choose to go to a private school in paris to learn Data Science and artificial intelligence.

### Currently

I have now 19 years old, i am in second year in my school. For juridic reasons i couldn't name them but i payd 7 890 € for making marketing and french classes that no one didn't care, I am now in intership for my last two years in this school. Anf fortunatly I start learning how to code by mylsef thanks to [OpenClassroom]('https://openclassrooms.com/') and all the official documentation online.

### The Future

I am currently working hard to achieve my goal of being a fullstack developper in 1 years, it will probably be a 1 year and 3 months but thats all right. I hope that i will be able to start my first Tech company in a few years.
