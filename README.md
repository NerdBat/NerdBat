### Before Coding

I Started coding with java at age 11 ( big fan og minecraft ), then because of my lack of knowledge I stop after 3 month.
Then a few years after, we started learning python in math class. I was terrible at math but the best of all the student in python.
I got the best grade and i knew that i wanted to work as progrommaer. At the end of the year i changed of school to take my last 2 yers of high school in STI2D.
